## WATER CHEMISTRY
### 1. Sources of water:
**Water is a critical resource for human survival and livelihood. It is essential for drinking, agriculture, industry, and ecosystem health. There are three sources of water on Earth:**

**1. Rainwater**: Rainwater is one of the most abundant sources of water, supplying the majority of the world's freshwater. While it is not always consistent, rainwater can be harvested and stored for future use, providing a reliable source of water in many regions.

**2. Surface Water:** Surface water includes rivers, lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water on the surface of the Earth. This type of water is essential for aquatic ecosystems. It can not be directly used for domestic purpose.

**3. Groundwater:** Groundwater is the water that exists beneath the Earth's surface, trapped in porous soil or rock layers. This type of water is essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems and is also a vital source of water for human use. It can be accessed using wells, pumps, or other technologies and is often used for irrigation and drinking water purposes.

### Impurities in Water:
**Some of the most common impurities found in water are:**

**Solids:** These can include dirt, sand, and other particles that can be suspended in the water or settle at the bottom. They can also include sediment or silt, which is a combination of solids and organic matter.

**Dissolved gases:** Carbon dioxide is a common dissolved gas in water, but other gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen can also be present.

**Organic compounds:** These can include natural organic compounds such as organic matter from plants and animals, fugai and algi, as well as synthetic organic compounds such as pesticides and detergents.

**Pathogens:** These include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause illness in humans and animals.

**Chemical pollutants:** These can include synthetic chemicals and industrial solvents that have been discharged into water sources.

### Hardness of Water:
**Property of water due to which it doesn't make lather (foam) with soap. It is due to the presence of salts of Calcium and magnesium. Hardness of water is of two types:**

| Temporary hardness | Permanent Hardness |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **1.** Temporary hardness is also known as Carbonate Hardness. | **1.** Permanent hardness is also known as non-carbonate hardness.  |
| **2.** It is due to the salts of carbonantes.  CaCO₃, MgCO₃, Ca(HCO₃)₂, Mg(HCO₃)₂ | **2.** It is due to the salts of chlorine, sulphate and nitrates. CaCl₂, MgCl₂, CaSO₄, MgSO₄, Ca(NO₃)₂, Mg(NO₃)₂ |
| **3.** It can easily be removed by boiling.| **3.** It can be removed by special methods. |
| Ca(HCO₃)₂(aq) → CaCO₃(s) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g) |Lime soda process, Zeolite Process, Ion exchange process |


### QUESTION:
**Why hard water doesn't make lather with soap?**
### ANSWER
**CaSO₄(aq) + 2C₁₇H₃₅COONa(aq) → Ca(C₁₇H₃₅COO)₂(s) + Na₂SO₄(aq)**

**Calcium sulfate + Sodium Stearate → Calcium stearate + Sodium sulfate**

*Hard water is water that contains salts of calcium and magnesium, which react with  Sodium Sterate (soap molecules) and form white scum, a sticky and greasy residue on surfaces.*
